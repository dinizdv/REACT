# Films project
‚úîÔ∏è This project uses the https://api.themoviedb.org/3/ API to illustrate the films currently showing at the cinema. Information such as film id, name, vote average and film cover were some of the data I collected from this API.

‚úîÔ∏è The project is 100% responsive and contains some interesting sections such as the general films page (1), a section for individual film details (2), and a favorite films page (3), which are stored in localStorage. It is also possible to access the film trailer directly through the application.
